## About this game
```
Din is a mandalorian living in the post-empire era. He is one of the last remaining members of his clan in the galaxy and is currently on a mission for the Guild. He needs to rescue The Child, who strikingly resembles Master Yoda, a legendary Jedi grandmaster. But there are lots of obstacles in his way, trying to prevent Din from saving Baby Yoda. Din is wearing classic mandalorian armour and has a jetpack as well as a blaster with unlimited bullets. Weâ€™ve got to help him fight his way through and rescue Baby Yoda.
This game consists of one level. You will see that this game is quite a replica of the original game. You win when you defeat the **Boss enemy**. Rest of the details are stated below explicitly for each element of the game.
The game is a classic combination of Jurassic park(movie series),Jetpack Joyride that is why I named it "Jurassic Jet".
